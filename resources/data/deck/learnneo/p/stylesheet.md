###Advice

Training content is different than self-study content. 

<details>
<summary>Training material</summary>
Training material _augments_ the lecture. The audience should be focused on what the speaker is
saying; the slides support the lecture. An important concept in writing
training material is to avoid a _wall of words_, where there are lengthy
paragraphs. People will read what's in front of them. If you have a lecture slide
with a lot of text, your audience will be reading while you are lecturing, 
and information is lost.
